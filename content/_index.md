### for educational data science {#subtitle}




Welcome to the second course in the [Educational Data Science Specialization](https://education.uoregon.edu/data-science-specialization-educational-leadership) taught at the University of Oregon through the College of Education. This course will be taught through [R](https://cran.r-project.org), a free and open-source statistical computing environment, and will provide students with  the foundational principles and practice of data visualization, particularly as applied to scientific and technical data. We will have weekly lectures, covering a wide variety of topics including human perception, color theory, and principles of visual design. We will also cover mediums for communication across diverse audiences with an emphasis on different web applications. Weekly hands-on laboratory sessions provide students the opportunity to put the lecture material into practice.
