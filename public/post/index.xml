Some math:
$$ \varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887… $$$$ \varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887… $$
More math:
$$\varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } } $$$$ \varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } } $$</description>

      <description>Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity. Carl Jung  The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it. Carl Jung  Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.</description>

      <description>Inspired by this discussion, I wanted the ability to style a markdown table with Bootstrap table classes. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished this by defining the table in a data file, then building it with a shortcode.
While this works fine, it&amp;rsquo;s better for a different use case. I wanted something that meets the following criteria:
 The table is defined in markdown It lives in the content file, e.g. content/post/some-post.</description>

      <description>This was originally a question posed on the hugo discussion forums.
The user wanted to loop through all her content files and add a weight page-level variable to the front matter. The value of weight needed to be the first 2 characters of the content filename, since her content was named like 01_content.md, 02_content.md, etc.
She then wanted to range through her pages by their weight, like so:
{{ range .</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
